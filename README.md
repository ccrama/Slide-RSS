# Slide-RSS
A simple to use RSS feed reader with a similar UI to Slide for Reddit. 

A lot of the code comes from [Slide](/ccrama/Slide), so the look and feel of Slide RSS is very similar. So far, loading articles, adding feeds, and offline/cached data is working. 

#Not working
* Actionbar items
* Hide articles FAB
* Shadowbox
* Search
* Caching on a schedule?
* Manage feeds screen (where you can drag)
* Feed "collections"
