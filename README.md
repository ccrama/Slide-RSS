# Slide-RSS
A simple to use RSS feed reader with a similar UI to Slide for Reddit. 

So far, I've imported a lot of UI logic, activity code, and helper code from Slide for Reddit. I have began the conversion process into Realm "Article" objects (instead of Reddit Submissions), but there is still a lot to do.

If you can figure out what's going on, feel free to contribute! But I don't expect anyone to be able to be able to interpret the code until I do a lot more refractoring and get it to a compilable state :S
